# multiobjective_comparison_operators
A suite of small matlab functions covering some common multi-objective comparison operators, aligning to COMM510 workshop 1, plus a few more. Including:

* Checking if one objective vector dominates another
* Checking if one objective vector weakly-dominates another
* Checking if one objective vector strictly dominates another
* Checking if one objective vector is favoured to another (using the favour relation)
* Checking if a set of objective vectors dominates a single other objective vector 
* Checking if a set of objective vectors weakly dominates a single other objective vector 
* Checking if a set of objective vectors strictly dominates a single other objective vector 
* Checking if a set of objective vectors is better than another set of objective vectors 
* Checking if a set of objective vectors dominates another set of objective vectors 
* Checking if a set of objective vectors weakly dominates another set of objective vectors  
* Checking if a set of objective vectors strictly dominates another set of objective vectors 
* Returning the number of elements of a set that dominate each of its members
* Returning the indices of the non-dominated elements of a set
* Returning the minimum k, for which an objective vector is k-optimal with respect to another set of objective vectors
