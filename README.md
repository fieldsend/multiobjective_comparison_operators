# multiobjective_comparison_operators
A suite of small matlab functions covering some common multi-objective comparison operators, namely:

* Checking if one objective vector dominates another
* Checking if one objective vector weakly-dominates another
* Checking if one objective vector strictly dominates another
* Checking if one objective vector is favoured to another (using the favour relation)
* Checking if a set of objective vectors dominates a single other objective vector 
* Checking if a set of objective vectors weakly dominates a single other objective vector 
* Checking if a set of objective vectors strictly dominates a single other objective vector 
* Returning the minimum k, for which an objective vector is k-optimal with respect to another set of objective vectors
